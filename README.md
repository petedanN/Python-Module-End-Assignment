# Employee Data Analysis for ABC Company.
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the employee data of ABC Company. We have been provided with a dataset consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns that cover various attributes such as age, team, position, salary, and height. The goal is to preprocess the dataset, conduct a series of analyses, and present key insights using Python. Additionally, visualizations are provided for better interpretation of the findings.

## Preprocessing
To ensure the dataset's integrity, we corrected the values in the "height" column by replacing them with random numbers between 150 and 180. This step was necessary as the existing height data was inconsistent.
Before conducting further analysis, the dataset was checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting. The dataset was cleaned to ensure that all values are ready for analysis.

## Analysis Tasks
1. Employee Distribution Across Teams
We determined the distribution of employees across various teams and calculated the percentage split relative to the total employee count. This gives an overview of team sizes within the company.We created a bar chart showing the number of employees in each team.

2. Employee Segregation Based on Positions
We analyzed the employees' distribution across different positions within the company. A bar chart was used to represent it.

3. Predominant Age Group
We find the age with highest number of employees with the help of bar plot.

4. Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
We calculated the total salary expenditure by team and position to identify which teams and roles have the highest salary, And we visulaize it in a Scatter plot.

5. Correlation Between Age and Salary
We investigated whether there is a correlation between an employeeâ€™s age and their salary. Correlation matrix is used to display the relationship between age and salary.
